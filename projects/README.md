# Projects in Multiple Scenarios 

Since there are many scenarios where TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) provide critical security solutions, the Teaclave TrustZone SDK can be leveraged to implement use cases such as Web3 private key protection and AI model protection. 

In the `project/`, we demonstrate real-world scenarios and offer essential primitives to help developers build secure applications tailored to their needs.

Currently, we have included one scenario, and we plan to add more in the future as we expand the project.

- **Web3 Private Key Protection**: AVAILABLE in `web3/`:

This provides a basic Web3 wallet implementation with security features such as attestation and multi-factor confirmation to ensure secure key management.
